    The general pipeline for preprocessing a cleaned dataset in Pandas DataFrame

    1. Separate the labels from the data. The label needs to be named 'label',
       otherwise there will be unexpected issues in parsing.
    2. Separate any other columns that are not part of the data itself, e.g.
       metadata such as the name of an image.
    3. If the data has not been train-test split, a split needs to be performed.
       This is not needed for data that has already been split.
    4. For each dataset (train/test), scale the data according to the mean/stdev
       of the training set. Then use that to transform the test set to avoid
       data leakage.
